### Types of instances offered by Azure

Azure offers a variety of instances for different use cases. Here are some of the common ones:

- Virtual Machines (VMs): They are the most basic and flexible type of instance. They can be configured to suit specific needs and can run any operating system.

- App Services: They are a managed platform as a service (PaaS) that allows you to build and deploy web applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- Functions: They are a serverless compute service that allows you to run code in response to events without having to manage servers.

- Containers: They allow you to package your applications and their dependencies into a single container that can be easily deployed and scaled.

- Databases: Azure offers a range of database services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Database for MySQL, which provide managed and scalable database services.

- Kubernetes: Azure offers Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to manage and orchestrate containerized applications using Kubernetes.

- Serverless Compute: Azure Functions, Azure Event Grid, and Azure Logic Apps are examples of serverless compute services that allow you to write and deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- Storage: Azure offers various types of storage services like Azure Blob Storage, Azure File Storage, and Azure Disk Storage, which provide scalable and durable storage options.

- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Azure offers Azure Machine Learning, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Bot Service to build and deploy machine learning models and chatbots.

These are just a few examples, and Azure offers a wide range of services to suit different needs.

#### What are the different types of instances offered by Azure?
Azure offers different types of instances such as Virtual Machines, App Services, Functions, and more.

#### How do I set up an Azure VM?
To set up an Azure VM, you can use the Azure CLI, Azure portal, or Azure PowerShell. Here are the general steps:
1. Create a resource group.
2. Create a virtual network and subnet.
3. Create a network security group.
4. Create a public IP address.
5. Create a network interface.
6. Create a virtual machine.
7. Configure the virtual machine's operating system.
8. Start the virtual machine.

#### What is the difference between Scale Set and Availability Set in Azure?
- Availability Set: Ensures that the VMs are spread across different fault domains and update domains. It provides high availability by keeping the VMs running even if one or more go down.
- Scale Set: Provides autoscaling and load balancing of VMs. It can automatically add or remove VMs based on defined rules.

#### What are the definitions of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networks.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provides a platform for building, running, and managing applications.
- SaaS (Software as a Service): Provides access to software applications over the internet.

#### What are the Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud models?
- Public Cloud: Provided by a third-party and accessible over the internet.
- Private Cloud: Provided by an organization within its own premises.
- Hybrid Cloud: Combines both public and private clouds.

#### How can I connect Azure VMs in different subscriptions?
To connect Azure VMs in different subscriptions, you can use peering, VPN, or Azure ExpressRoute.

#### What is an Application Gateway and how does it serve as an entry point?
- Application Gateway: It acts as an entry point for incoming traffic and provides load balancing, SSL offloading, and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities.
- Serves as an entry point: Application Gateway receives incoming traffic from the internet and directs it to the appropriate backend pool based on rules such as URL path or hostname.

#### What is an Address Prefix?
An address prefix is a subnet definition that specifies the range of IP addresses that can be used within that subnet.

#### What is Access Control (IAM) in Azure?
Access Control (IAM) in Azure is a way to manage access to resources in Azure. It allows you to assign roles to users, groups, or applications to control who can perform what actions on different resources.

#### What types of storage are available in Azure?
Azure offers various types of storage services like Azure Blob Storage, Azure File Storage, and Azure Disk Storage, which provide scalable and durable storage options.

#### What are Managed Identity, Service Connection, and Principal?

- Managed Identity: It is a feature that allows Azure resources to authenticate and access other Azure services or resources securely without the need for credentials or secrets.

- Service Connection: It is a way to connect to Azure resources securely without having to manage credentials. It allows you to connect to Azure resources using pre-defined settings and connections.

- Principal: It is an entity that represents a user, group, or service in Azure. It can be used to define permissions and access control settings.


#### How can I log in to Azure without sharing a username and password?
You can use Azure Active Directory (AD) to log in to Azure without sharing a username and password. For example, you can use Azure AD to sign in to the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.

#### How can I connect an On-Prem VM to an Azure VM?
You can use Azure ExpressRoute or a Site-to-Site VPN to connect an On-Prem VM to an Azure VM. For example, you can create an ExpressRoute circuit and connect it to your on-premises network using an ExpressRoute gateway.

#### What is Bastion and can it be replaced with a firewall?
Bastion is a service offered by Azure that allows you to securely connect to Azure VMs over the internet. It acts as an entry point for incoming traffic and provides a secure way to connect to your VMs. While it can be used as a replacement for a firewall, it is designed specifically for securely accessing VMs in Azure.

#### What are Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs)?
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources. They allow you to define rules that specify what traffic is allowed or denied. Application Security Groups (ASGs) are used to group network interfaces that belong to the same application. They allow you to apply security policies to groups of interfaces rather than individual interfaces.

#### What is the purpose of a Virtual Network in Azure?
A Virtual Network (VNet) provides a dedicated network space in which Azure resources can be deployed. It allows you to segment your network into different subnets, define IP address ranges, and control network traffic.

#### What types of resources are typically worked on in Azure?
Azure offers various types of resources, including Virtual Machines, App Services, Functions, Containers, Databases, Kubernetes, and more. Depending on your requirements, you can choose the appropriate resource type for your workload.

#### What services does Azure offer for high availability?
Azure offers several services to ensure high availability, including Availability Sets, Availability Zones, Load Balancers, and Application Gateways. For example, Availability Sets ensure that the VMs are spread across different fault domains and update domains to provide high availability. Load Balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple VMs to ensure that no single VM is overloaded.

#### How can I secure and patch an Azure VM?
You can secure and patch an Azure VM by following best practices for security and patch management. For example, you can use Azure Security Center to monitor and apply security recommendations, and configure the VM's automatic updates to ensure that the latest security patches are applied.
